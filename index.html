          <h3>One Act Plays</h3>
          <p class="titlegraph">An evening of shorts written by local playwrights (you). Laugh, cry, and bring your best horse sounds for that special horse role.</p>
          <h4>The Night</h4>
          <p><span>Welcome</span> Everyone who wishes to participate will be matched to roles and walk through quick read-throughs with their playwrights to develop blocking and get into character.</p>
          <p><span>Dinner</span> A potluck dinner will be served and the plays will begin promptly at 8:30PM. </p>
          <p><span>Awards</span> A command performance, award ceremony and encore follows to wrap the show.</p>
          <h4>For Playwrights</h4>
          <p>Write plays at least 20 seconds long but under 20 minutes. The stage is about 10 feet by 6 feet and there is an attached green room that opens onto the stage obscured from the audienceâ€™s prying eyes. </p>
          <p>No topics are off-limits but do be sensitive and warn of triggers. There is no obligation to be original. If you need special props, bring them! But we encourage you to keep it light and keep it sketchy.</p>
